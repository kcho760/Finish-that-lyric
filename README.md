Finish That Lyric is a web application built with Javascript that was built during my time at App Academy. Users are presented with the first part of the phrase from a song and has to guess the remaining words.

2) You can see more detailed instructions through the "How to Play" button, or start a new game with the "Begin" button.
3) A timer will countdown from 3 seconds and partially completed lyrics will appear on screen. There are 4 choices to choose from. Clicking on any of them marks them as your selection. Once you are satisfied with your choice, click next and the game will determine if you were correct.
4) You can use your lifelines. You get one of each per game:
    -50/50: Will remove two of the incorrect answers for you.
    -Second Chance: Will let you choose again if your answer was incorrect. It will also disable the incorrect button you already chose.
5) Keep playing until the game ends to see your final score.
